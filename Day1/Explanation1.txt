In this problem we are given a file of lines where we can encounter with 2 different problems:

1.In the first problem, we are asked to extract the first and last character of the line which are digits and then get the integer 
    value of the 2 integers put together: e.g. "1something9somethingelse" results in the integer number 19. We are asked to sum up 
    all integers from each line and return the total sum.

2. In the second case we also need to conside substrings that are alpha numeric. e.g. "two12something5" will result in the integer 25.

Solutions:
1. In the first case, we could go through each individual line twice (once from the start and once from the end) and when we 
    encounter a string digit, we can just append it to an empty-initialized string. We then return the int value of the resulting
    string and in a different function we collect the sum for all lines.
2. In the second case, we should define a dictionary which contains a map from the alphaNumeric digit to its String digit counterPart
    we would then check every substring of the current char in the line (we only need to check substrings of length 3,4 or 5). If
    the substring is in the dictionary, we can use the value to the corresponding key and append it to the empty-initialized string.
    Everything else stays the same.
